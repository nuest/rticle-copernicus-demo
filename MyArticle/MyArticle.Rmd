\introduction

Introduction text goes here.

Deadpool is great!

You can change the name of the section if neccessary using `\introduction[modified heading]`.

The following settings can or must be configured in the header of this file and are bespoke for Copernicus manuscripts:

- The `journal` you are submitting to using the official abbreviation. You can use the function `rticles::copernicus_journal_abbreviations(name = '...')` to search the existing journals.

- Specific sections of the manuscript:

  - `running` with `title` and `author`

  - `competinginterests`

  - `copyrightstatement` (optional)

  - `availability` (strongly recommended if any used), one of `code`, `data`, or `codedata`

  - `authorcontribution`

  - `disclaimer`

  - `acknowledgements`
  
See the defaults and examples from the skeleton and the official Copernicus documentation for details.

# Content section one

## Subsection Heading Here

Subsection text here. 

### Subsubsection Heading Here

\lipsum[2]

# Content section with citations

See the [R Markdown docs for bibliographies and citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html).

Copernicus supports biblatex and a sample bibliography is in file `sample.bib`.
Read [@Feynman1963118], and [see @Dirac1953888].

# Examples from the official template

## FIGURES

When figures and tables are placed at the end of the MS (article in one-column style), please add \clearpage between bibliography and first table and/or figure as well as between each table and/or figure.

### ONE-COLUMN FIGURES

This is how you can include a 12cm width figure of Nikolaus Copernicus from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg) with caption using R Markdown.

```{r, out.width = "8.3cm", fig.cap = "one column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

### TWO-COLUMN FIGURES

You can also include a larger figure and hide the code for including it.

```{r, out.width = "12cm", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "two column figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("Nikolaus_Kopernikus.jpg")
```

## TABLES

You can ad \LaTeX table in an R Markdown document to meet the template requirements.

### ONE-COLUMN TABLE

\begin{table}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{Table Footnotes}
\end{table}

### TWO-COLUMN TABLE

\begin{table*}[t]
\caption{TEXT}
\begin{tabular}{l c r}
\tophline

a & b & c \\
\middlehline
1 & 2 & 3 \\

\bottomhline
\end{tabular}
\belowtable{Table footnotes}
\end{table*}

## MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS

All papers typeset by Copernicus Publications follow the math typesetting regulations given by the IUPAC Green Book (IUPAC: Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry, 2nd Edn., Blackwell Science, available at: http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf, 1993).

Physical quantities/variables are typeset in italic font (t for time, T for Temperature)

Indices which are not defined are typeset in italic font (x, y, z, a, b, c)

Items/objects which are defined are typeset in roman font (Car A, Car B)

Descriptions/specifications which are defined by itself are typeset in roman font (abs, rel, ref, tot, net, ice)

Abbreviations from 2 letters are typeset in roman font (RH, LAI)

Vectors are identified in bold italic font using \vec{x}

Matrices are identified in bold roman font

Multiplication signs are typeset using the LaTeX commands `\times` (for vector products, grids, and exponential notations) or `\cdot`

The character * should not be applied as mutliplication sign

## EQUATIONS

### Single-row equation

$$
1 \times 1 \cdot 1 = 42
$$

### Multiline equation

\begin{align}
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8\\
& 3 + 5 = 8
\end{align}

## MATRICES

$$
\begin{matrix}
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
x & y & z\\
\end{matrix}
$$

## ALGORITHM

<!-- requires you to have either algorithm.sty or algorithmic.sty installed, the former is be dedault added to the header - see header. -->
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Algorithm Caption}
\label{a1}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $i\gets 10$
\IF {$i\geq 5$} 
        \STATE $i\gets i-1$
\ELSE
        \IF {$i\leq 3$}
                \STATE $i\gets i+2$
        \ENDIF
\ENDIF
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

## CHEMICAL FORMULAS AND REACTIONS

For formulas embedded in the text, please use `\chem{}`, e.g. \chem{A \rightarrow B}.

The reaction environment creates labels including the letter R, i.e. (R1), (R2), etc.

- `\rightarrow` should be used for normal (one-way) chemical reactions

- `\rightleftharpoons` should be used for equilibria

- `\leftrightarrow` should be used for resonance structures

\begin{reaction}
A \rightarrow B \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Coper \rightleftharpoons nicus \\
\end{reaction}
\begin{reaction}
Publi \leftrightarrow cations
\end{reaction}

## PHYSICAL UNITS

Please use `\unit{}` and apply the exponential notation

\conclusions

The conclusion goes here.
You can modify the section name with  `\conclusions[modified heading if necessary]`.
